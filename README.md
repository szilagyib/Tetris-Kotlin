# Tetris-Kotlin

This is a classic Tetris game desktop application implemented in Kotlin using TornadoFX.

You can pause and resume the game and there is also a leaderboard at the end of the game. You can (have to) listen to the famous song Korobeiniki while playing (there is no mute button - muting would be a sin).
